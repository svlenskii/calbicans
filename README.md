# Exploring virome of fungal pathogens: insights from the public transcriptomic data

Fungal infections, especially those caused by _Candida albicans_, are a serious health concern. While much research has explored _C. albicans_' genetics and gene activity, little attention has been paid to its virome. This paper sets out to analyze _C.albicans_' virome using existing sequencing data. By doing so, we uncover various viral elements interacting with the fungus and shed light on their impact. Our findings reveal a diverse virome alongside _C.albicans_. This research expands our understanding of _C.albicans_' virome and lays the groundwork for further exploration into how fungi and viruses interact. These insights could lead to innovative treatments for fungal infections.
